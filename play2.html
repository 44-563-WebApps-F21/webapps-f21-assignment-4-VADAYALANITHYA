        <h3> The Market Place of Padua</h3>
        <p style="white-space: pre"></p>
        <p>The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
            Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
            black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
            Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
            _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
            windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
            is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
            conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
            is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
            passing into the Cathedral_.</p>>

            [_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
            
               Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another
               step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
               yours!
            <h6 class="name GUIDO_" > GUIDO_</h6>
               I think it must be here.  <p class="stage_directions">[_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]</p>
              <p class="SPEECH"> Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
               Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.</p>
