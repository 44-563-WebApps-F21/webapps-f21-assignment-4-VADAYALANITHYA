        <h2> The Duchess of Padua</h2>
        <h3> The Market Place of Padua</h3>
        <H6>The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
            Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
            black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
            Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
            _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
            windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
            is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
            conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
            is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
            passing into the Cathedral_.<H6>
            <P>
            [_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
            
               Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another
               step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
               yours!
            GUIDO
               I think it must be here.  [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]
               Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
               Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Well?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Ay! it is here.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.
            
            GUIDO
            
               [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;
               the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
               Day.’
            
            ASCANIO
            
               And what of the man, how shall we know him?
            
            GUIDO [_reading still_]
            
               ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
               shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
               your father?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
               just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
               man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
               signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
               know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
               writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
               that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
               some one he had never since seen.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               And you don’t know who your father is?
            
            GUIDO
            
               No.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               No recollection of him even?
            
            GUIDO
            
               None, Ascanio, none.
            
            ASCANIO [_laughing_]
            
               Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did
               mine.
            
            GUIDO [_smiling_]
            
               I am sure you never deserved it.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Never; and that made it worse.  I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to
               buoy me up.  What hour did you say he fixed?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Noon.
            
                                                   [_Clock in the Cathedral strikes_.]
            
            ASCANIO
            
               It is that now, and your man has not come.  I don’t believe in him,
               Guido.  I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I
               have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me
               to the nearest tavern.  [_Rises_.]  By the great gods of eating,
               Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as tired as a young
               maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk’s sermon.  Come, Guido,
               you stand there looking at nothing, like the fool who tried to look
               into his own mind; your man will not come.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!  [_Just as he is leaving the stage
               with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
               silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
               Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
               him_.]
