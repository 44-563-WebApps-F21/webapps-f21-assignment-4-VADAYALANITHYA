        <h2> The Duchess of Padua</h2>
        <h3> The Market Place of Padua</h3>
        <p>
            _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
            Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
            black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
            Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
            _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
            windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
            is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
            conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
            is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
            passing into the Cathedral_.
            
            [_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
            
               Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another
               step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
               yours!
            
                                            [_Sits down on the step of the fountain_.]
            
            GUIDO
            
               I think it must be here.  [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]
               Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
               Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Well?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Ay! it is here.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.
            
            GUIDO
            
               [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;
               the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
               Day.’
            
            ASCANIO
            
               And what of the man, how shall we know him?
            
            GUIDO [_reading still_]
            
               ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
               shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
               your father?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
               just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
               man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
               signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
               know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
               writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
               that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
               some one he had never since seen.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               And you don’t know who your father is?
            
            GUIDO
            
               No.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               No recollection of him even?
            
            GUIDO
            
               None, Ascanio, none.
            
            ASCANIO [_laughing_]
            
               Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did
               mine.
            
            GUIDO [_smiling_]
            
               I am sure you never deserved it.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Never; and that made it worse.  I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to
               buoy me up.  What hour did you say he fixed?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Noon.
            
                                                   [_Clock in the Cathedral strikes_.]
            
            ASCANIO
            
               It is that now, and your man has not come.  I don’t believe in him,
               Guido.  I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I
               have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me
               to the nearest tavern.  [_Rises_.]  By the great gods of eating,
               Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as tired as a young
               maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk’s sermon.  Come, Guido,
               you stand there looking at nothing, like the fool who tried to look
               into his own mind; your man will not come.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!  [_Just as he is leaving the stage
               with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
               silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
               Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
               him_.]
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.
            
            GUIDO
            
               What!  Does my father live?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay! lives in thee.
               Thou art the same in mould and lineament,
               Carriage and form, and outward semblances;
               I trust thou art in noble mind the same.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived
               But for this moment.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               We must be alone.
            
            GUIDO
            
               This is my dearest friend, who out of love
               Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,
               There is no secret which we do not share.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               There is one secret which ye shall not share;
               Bid him go hence.
            
            GUIDO [_to_ ASCANIO]
            
               Come back within the hour.
               He does not know that nothing in this world
               Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.
               Within the hour come.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Speak not to him,
               There is a dreadful terror in his look.
            
            GUIDO [_laughing_]
            
               Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
               That I am some great Lord of Italy,
               And we will have long days of joy together.
               Within the hour, dear Ascanio.
            
                                                                     [_Exit_ ASCANIO.]
            
               Now tell me of my father?  [_Sits down on a stone seat_.]
               Stood he tall?
               I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.
               His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,
               Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?
               The very bravest men have voices sometimes
               Full of low music; or a clarion was it
               That brake with terror all his enemies?
               Did he ride singly? or with many squires
               And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?
               For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins
               Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.
            
            GUIDO [_proudly_]
            
               Then when you saw my noble father last
               He was set high above the heads of men?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay, he was high above the heads of men,
            
            [_Walks over to_ GUIDO _and puts his hand upon his shoulder_.]
            
               On a red scaffold, with a butcher’s block
               Set for his neck.
            
            GUIDO [_leaping up_]
            
               What dreadful man art thou,
               That like a raven, or the midnight owl,
               Com’st with this awful message from the grave?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               I am known here as the Count Moranzone,
               Lord of a barren castle on a rock,
               With a few acres of unkindly land
               And six not thrifty servants.  But I was one
               Of Parma’s noblest princes; more than that,
               I was your father’s friend.
            
            GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]
            
               Tell me of him.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,
               He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke
               Of all the fair domains of Lombardy
               Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even
               Was wont to pay him tribute—
            
            GUIDO
            
               Come to his death.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               You will hear that soon enough.  Being at war—
               O noble lion of war, that would not suffer
               Injustice done in Italy!—he led
               The very flower of chivalry against
               That foul adulterous Lord of Rimini,
               Giovanni Malatesta—whom God curse!
               And was by him in treacherous ambush taken,
               And like a villain, or a low-born knave,
               Was by him on the public scaffold murdered.
            
            GUIDO [_clutching his dagger_]
            
               Doth Malatesta live?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               No, he is dead.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Did you say dead?  O too swift runner, Death,
               Couldst thou not wait for me a little space,
               And I had done thy bidding!
            
            MORANZONE [_clutching his wrist_]
            
               Thou canst do it!
               The man who sold thy father is alive.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Sold! was my father sold?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay! trafficked for,
               Like a vile chattel, for a price betrayed,
               Bartered and bargained for in privy market
               By one whom he had held his perfect friend,
               One he had trusted, one he had well loved,
               One whom by ties of kindness he had bound—
            
            GUIDO
            
               And he lives
               Who sold my father?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               I will bring you to him.
            
            GUIDO
            
               So, Judas, thou art living! well, I will make
               This world thy field of blood, so buy it straight-way,
               For thou must hang there.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Judas said you, boy?
               Yes, Judas in his treachery, but still
               He was more wise than Judas was, and held
               Those thirty silver pieces not enough.
            
            GUIDO
            
               What got he for my father’s blood?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               What got he?
               Why cities, fiefs, and principalities,
               Vineyards, and lands.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Of which he shall but keep
               Six feet of ground to rot in.  Where is he,
               This damned villain, this foul devil? where?
               Show me the man, and come he cased in steel,
               In complete panoply and pride of war,
               Ay, guarded by a thousand men-at-arms,
               Yet I shall reach him through their spears, and feel
               The last black drop of blood from his black heart
               Crawl down my blade.  Show me the man, I say,
               And I will kill him.
            
            MORANZONE [_coldly_]
            
               Fool, what revenge is there?
               Death is the common heritage of all,
               And death comes best when it comes suddenly.
            
                                                           [_Goes up close to_ GUIDO.]
            
               Your father was betrayed, there is your cue;
               For you shall sell the seller in his turn.
               I will make you of his household, you shall sit
               At the same board with him, eat of his bread—
            
            GUIDO
            
               O bitter bread!
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Thy palate is too nice,
               Revenge will make it sweet.  Thou shalt o’ nights
               Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and be
               His intimate, so he will fawn on thee,
               Love thee, and trust thee in all secret things.
               If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh,
               And if it be his humour to be sad
               Thou shalt don sables.  Then when the time is ripe—
            
                                                         [GUIDO _clutches his sword_.]
            
               Nay, nay, I trust thee not; your hot young blood,
               Undisciplined nature, and too violent rage
               Will never tarry for this great revenge,
               But wreck itself on passion.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Thou knowest me not.
               Tell me the man, and I in everything
               Will do thy bidding.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Well, when the time is ripe,
               The victim trusting and the occasion sure,
               I will by sudden secret messenger
               Send thee a sign.
            
            GUIDO
            
               How shall I kill him, tell me?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               That night thou shalt creep into his private chamber;
               But if he sleep see that thou wake him first,
               And hold thy hand upon his throat, ay! that way,
               Then having told him of what blood thou art,
               Sprung from what father, and for what revenge,
               Bid him to pray for mercy; when he prays,
               Bid him to set a price upon his life,
               And when he strips himself of all his gold
               Tell him thou needest not gold, and hast not mercy,
               And do thy business straight away.  Swear to me
               Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it,
               Or else I go to mine own house, and leave
               Thee ignorant, and thy father unavenged.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Now by my father’s sword—
            
            MORANZONE
            
               The common hangman
               Brake that in sunder in the public square.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Then by my father’s grave—
            
            MORANZONE
            
               What grave? what grave?
               Your noble father lieth in no grave,
               I saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes
               Whirled through the windy streets like common straws
               To plague a beggar’s eyesight, and his head,
               That gentle head, set on the prison spike,
               For the vile rabble in their insolence
               To shoot their tongues at.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Was it so indeed?
               Then by my father’s spotless memory,
               And by the shameful manner of his death,
               And by the base betrayal by his friend,
               For these at least remain, by these I swear
               I will not lay my hand upon his life
               Until you bid me, then—God help his soul,
               For he shall die as never dog died yet.
               And now, the sign, what is it?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               This dagger, boy;
               It was your father’s.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Oh, let me look at it!
               I do remember now my reputed uncle,
               That good old husbandman I left at home,
               Told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe
               Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold;
               I like them best in steel, as they are here,
               They suit my purpose better.  Tell me, sir,
               Have you no message from my father to me?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Poor boy, you never saw that noble father,
               For when by his false friend he had been sold,
               Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped
               To bear the news to Parma to the Duchess.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Speak to me of my mother.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               When thy mother
               Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon,
               And, being with untimely travail seized—
               Bare thee into the world before thy time,
               And then her soul went heavenward, to wait
               Thy father, at the gates of Paradise.
            
            GUIDO
            
               A mother dead, a father sold and bartered!
               I seem to stand on some beleaguered wall,
               And messenger comes after messenger
               With a new tale of terror; give me breath,
               Mine ears are tired.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               When thy mother died,
               Fearing our enemies, I gave it out
               Thou wert dead also, and then privily
               Conveyed thee to an ancient servitor,
               Who by Perugia lived; the rest thou knowest.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Saw you my father afterwards?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay! once;
               In mean attire, like a vineyard dresser,
               I stole to Rimini.
            
            GUIDO [_taking his hand_]
            
               O generous heart!
            
            MORANZONE
            
               One can buy everything in Rimini,
               And so I bought the gaolers! when your father
               Heard that a man child had been born to him,
               His noble face lit up beneath his helm
               Like a great fire seen far out at sea,
               And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido,
               To rear you worthy of him; so I have reared you
               To revenge his death upon the friend who sold him.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Thou hast done well; I for my father thank thee.
               And now his name?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               How you remind me of him,
               You have each gesture that your father had.
            
            GUIDO
            
               The traitor’s name?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Thou wilt hear that anon;
               The Duke and other nobles at the Court
               Are coming hither.
            
            GUIDO
            
               What of that? his name?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Do they not seem a valiant company
               Of honourable, honest gentlemen?
            
            GUIDO
            
               His name, milord?
            
            [_Enter the_ DUKE OF PADUA _with_ COUNT BARDI, MAFFIO, PETRUCCI, _and
            other gentlemen of his Court_.]
            
            MORANZONE [_quickly_]
            
               The man to whom I kneel
               Is he who sold your father! mark me well.
            
            GUIDO [_clutches hit dagger_]
            
               The Duke!
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Leave off that fingering of thy knife.
               Hast thou so soon forgotten?  [_Kneels to the_ DUKE.]
               My noble Lord.
            
            DUKE
            
               Welcome, Count Moranzone; ’tis some time
               Since we have seen you here in Padua.
               We hunted near your castle yesterday—
               Call you it castle? that bleak house of yours
               Wherein you sit a-mumbling o’er your beads,
               Telling your vices like a good old man.
            
                                         [_Catches sight of_ GUIDO _and starts back_.]
            
               Who is that?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               My sister’s son, your Grace,
               Who being now of age to carry arms,
               Would for a season tarry at your Court
            
            DUKE [_still looking at_ GUIDO]
            
               What is his name?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Guido Ferranti, sir.
            
            DUKE
            
               His city?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               He is Mantuan by birth.
            
            DUKE [_advancing towards_ GUIDO]
            
               You have the eyes of one I used to know,
               But he died childless.  Are you honest, boy?
               Then be not spendthrift of your honesty,
               But keep it to yourself; in Padua
               Men think that honesty is ostentatious, so
               It is not of the fashion.  Look at these lords.
            
            COUNT BARDI [_aside_]
            
               Here is some bitter arrow for us, sure.
            
            DUKE
            
               Why, every man among them has his price,
               Although, to do them justice, some of them
               Are quite expensive.
            
            COUNT BARDI [_aside_]
            
               There it comes indeed.
            
            DUKE
            
               So be not honest; eccentricity
               Is not a thing should ever be encouraged,
               Although, in this dull stupid age of ours,
               The most eccentric thing a man can do
               Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him;
               And for the mob, despise it as I do,
               I hold its bubble praise and windy favours
               In such account, that popularity
               Is the one insult I have never suffered.
            
            MAFFIO [_aside_]
            
               He has enough of hate, if he needs that.
            
            DUKE
            
               Have prudence; in your dealings with the world
               Be not too hasty; act on the second thought,
               First impulses are generally good.
            
            GUIDO [_aside_]
            
               Surely a toad sits on his lips, and spills its venom there.
            
            DUKE
            
               See thou hast enemies,
               Else will the world think very little of thee;
               It is its test of power; yet see thou show’st
               A smiling mask of friendship to all men,
               Until thou hast them safely in thy grip,
               Then thou canst crush them.
            
            GUIDO [_aside_]
            
               O wise philosopher!
               That for thyself dost dig so deep a grave.
            
            MORANZONE [_to him_]
            
               Dost thou mark his words?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Oh, be thou sure I do.
            
            DUKE
            
               And be not over-scrupulous; clean hands
               With nothing in them make a sorry show.
               If you would have the lion’s share of life
               You must wear the fox’s skin.  Oh, it will fit you;
               It is a coat which fitteth every man.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Your Grace, I shall remember.
            
            DUKE
            
               That is well, boy, well.
               I would not have about me shallow fools,
               Who with mean scruples weigh the gold of life,
               And faltering, paltering, end by failure; failure,
               The only crime which I have not committed:
               I would have _men_ about me.  As for conscience,
               Conscience is but the name which cowardice
               Fleeing from battle scrawls upon its shield.
               You understand me, boy?
            
            GUIDO
            
               I do, your Grace,
               And will in all things carry out the creed
               Which you have taught me.
            
            MAFFIO
            
               I never heard your Grace
               So much in the vein for preaching; let the Cardinal
               Look to his laurels, sir.
            
            DUKE
            
               The Cardinal!
               Men follow my creed, and they gabble his.
               I do not think much of the Cardinal;
               Although he is a holy churchman, and
               I quite admit his dulness.  Well, sir, from now
               We count you of our household
            
            [_He holds out his hand for_ GUIDO _to kiss_.  GUIDO _starts back in
            horror_, _but at a gesture from_ COUNT MORANZONE, _kneels and kisses
            it_.]
            
               We will see
               That you are furnished with such equipage
               As doth befit your honour and our state.
            
            GUIDO
            
               I thank your Grace most heartily.
            
            DUKE
            
               Tell me again
               What is your name?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Guido Ferranti, sir.
            
            DUKE
            
               And you are Mantuan?  Look to your wives, my lords,
               When such a gallant comes to Padua.
               Thou dost well to laugh, Count Bardi; I have noted
               How merry is that husband by whose hearth
               Sits an uncomely wife.
            
            MAFFIO
            
               May it please your Grace,
               The wives of Padua are above suspicion.
            
            DUKE
            
               What, are they so ill-favoured!  Let us go,
               This Cardinal detains our pious Duchess;
               His sermon and his beard want cutting both:
               Will you come with us, sir, and hear a text
               From holy Jerome?
            
            MORANZONE [_bowing_]
            
               My liege, there are some matters—
            
            DUKE [_interrupting_]
            
               Thou need’st make no excuse for missing mass.
               Come, gentlemen.
            
                                               [_Exit with his suite into Cathedral_.]
            
            GUIDO [_after a pause_]
            
               So the Duke sold my father;
               I kissed his hand.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Thou shalt do that many times.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Must it be so?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay! thou hast sworn an oath.
            
            GUIDO
            
               That oath shall make me marble.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Farewell, boy,
               Thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe.
            
            GUIDO
            
               I pray thou comest quickly.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               I will come
               When it is time; be ready.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Fear me not.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Here is your friend; see that you banish him
               Both from your heart and Padua.
            
            GUIDO
            
               From Padua,
               Not from my heart.
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Nay, from thy heart as well,
               I will not leave thee till I see thee do it.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Can I have no friend?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Revenge shall be thy friend;
               Thou need’st no other.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Well, then be it so.
            
                                                         [_Enter_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Come, Guido, I have been beforehand with you in everything, for I have
               drunk a flagon of wine, eaten a pasty, and kissed the maid who served
               it.  Why, you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot buy apples,
               or a politician who cannot sell his vote.  What news, Guido, what
               news?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Why, that we two must part, Ascanio.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               That would be news indeed, but it is not true.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Too true it is, you must get hence, Ascanio,
               And never look upon my face again.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               No, no; indeed you do not know me, Guido;
               ’Tis true I am a common yeoman’s son,
               Nor versed in fashions of much courtesy;
               But, if you are nobly born, cannot I be
               Your serving man?  I will tend you with more love
               Than any hired servant.
            
            GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]
            
               Ascanio!
            
                 [_Sees_ MORANZONE _looking at him and drops_ ASCANIO’S _hand_.]
            
               It cannot be.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               What, is it so with you?
               I thought the friendship of the antique world
               Was not yet dead, but that the Roman type
               Might even in this poor and common age
               Find counterparts of love; then by this love
               Which beats between us like a summer sea,
               Whatever lot has fallen to your hand
               May I not share it?
            
            GUIDO
            
               Share it?
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Ay!
            
            GUIDO
            
               No, no.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Have you then come to some inheritance
               Of lordly castle, or of stored-up gold?
            
            GUIDO [_bitterly_]
            
               Ay! I have come to my inheritance.
               O bloody legacy! and O murderous dole!
               Which, like the thrifty miser, must I hoard,
               And to my own self keep; and so, I pray you,
               Let us part here.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               What, shall we never more
               Sit hand in hand, as we were wont to sit,
               Over some book of ancient chivalry
               Stealing a truant holiday from school,
               Follow the huntsmen through the autumn woods,
               And watch the falcons burst their tasselled jesses,
               When the hare breaks from covert.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Never more.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Must I go hence without a word of love?
            
            GUIDO
            
               You must go hence, and may love go with you.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               You are unknightly, and ungenerous.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Unknightly and ungenerous if you will.
               Why should we waste more words about the matter
               Let us part now.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Have you no message, Guido?
            
            GUIDO
            
               None; my whole past was but a schoolboy’s dream;
               To-day my life begins.  Farewell.
            
            ASCANIO
            
               Farewell [_exit slowly_.]
            
            GUIDO
            
               Now are you satisfied?  Have you not seen
               My dearest friend, and my most loved companion,
               Thrust from me like a common kitchen knave!
               Oh, that I did it!  Are you not satisfied?
            
            MORANZONE
            
               Ay! I am satisfied.  Now I go hence,
               Do not forget the sign, your father’s dagger,
               And do the business when I send it to you.
            
            GUIDO
            
               Be sure I shall.  [_Exit_ LORD MORANZONE.]
            
            GUIDO
            
               O thou eternal heaven!
               If there is aught of nature in my soul,
               Of gentle pity, or fond kindliness,
               Wither it up, blast it, bring it to nothing,
               Or if thou wilt not, then will I myself
               Cut pity with a sharp knife from my heart
               And strangle mercy in her sleep at night
               Lest she speak to me.  Vengeance there I have it.
               Be thou my comrade and my bedfellow,
               Sit by my side, ride to the chase with me,
               When I am weary sing me pretty songs,
               When I am light o’ heart, make jest with me,
               And when I dream, whisper into my ear
               The dreadful secret of a father’s murder—
               Did I say murder?  [_Draws his dagger_.]
               Listen, thou terrible God!
               Thou God that punishest all broken oaths,
               And bid some angel write this oath in fire,
               That from this hour, till my dear father’s murder
               In blood I have revenged, I do forswear
               The noble ties of honourable friendship,
               The noble joys of dear companionship,
               Affection’s bonds, and loyal gratitude,
               Ay, more, from this same hour I do forswear
               All love of women, and the barren thing
               Which men call beauty—
            
            [_The organ peals in the Cathedral_, _and under a canopy of cloth of
            silver tissue_, _borne by four pages in scarlet_, _the_ DUCHESS OF PADUA
            _comes down the steps_; _as she passes across their eyes meet for a
            moment_, _and as she leaves the stage she looks back at_ GUIDO, _and the
            dagger falls from his hand_.]
            
               Oh! who is that?
            
            A CITIZEN
            
               The Duchess of Padua!
